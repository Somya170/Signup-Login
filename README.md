Java Web Application: Login System using Servlets and JSP
This project demonstrates a simple login system implemented with Java Servlets and JSP, integrated with MySQL for database management.

Features
Login Page: Users can enter their credentials (username and password) to authenticate.
Session Management: Utilizes session tracking to maintain user login state.
MySQL Database: Stores user information securely.
Responsive Design: Uses JSP for dynamic web page rendering based on user input.
Technologies Used
Java Servlets: Handle HTTP requests, process login logic, and interact with the database.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Dynamic web pages for presenting login forms and handling user interaction.
MySQL: Backend database to store and retrieve user credentials.
JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): Connects Java application (servlets) with the MySQL database.
Apache Tomcat: Servlet container for deploying and running the web application.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/login-system.git
Set up MySQL database:

Create a database named login_system.
Create a table named users with columns username and password.
Insert some sample user data into the users table.
Configure database connection:

Open LoginServlet.java and update the MySQL database connection details:
java
Copy code
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/login_system";
String username = "your_mysql_username";
String password = "your_mysql_password";
Deploy the application:

Deploy the application on Apache Tomcat or any servlet container.
Access the application:

Navigate to http://localhost:8080/login (assuming default Tomcat configuration).
Enter valid credentials stored in the database to log in.
Usage
Navigate to login.jsp to access the login form.
Enter valid credentials stored in the database to log in.
Future Improvements
Enhance security features (e.g., password hashing).
Implement user registration functionality.
Improve UI/UX for a more seamless experience.
